# Myeloproliferative neoplasm patient cohort data visualization

This web application allows the user to explore interactively data from a cohort of 113 myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) blood donors and 15 healthy blood controls.


## Features

### Cohort exploration

Represent and compare graphically several variables describing the cohort.

### Variants exploration

Filter variants to select only the somatic mutations with sufficient evidence. Represent mutated gene per patient and co-occurrence of variants, as well as variants per disease and disease subtypes.

### Aberrations and gene fusions exploration

Represent co-occurences of variants and genomic aberrations, occurences of aberrations per disease, and display summary of genetic events per patient.
